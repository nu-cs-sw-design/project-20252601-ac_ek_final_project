|        | Input                                                                            | (if more to consider for input)                                                     | Output                                                                                                                    |

| Step 1 | player ID                                                                        | index of card from chosen player                                                    | chosen card gets added to hand of current player from chosen player's hand                                                |
| Step 2 | interval                                                                         | interval                                                                            | array of cards: current player's hand, array of cards: chosen player's hand                                               |
| Step 3 | [2 to #players] - only need to test 1 value - getPlayer method is tested in game | [0 to #cards-1] - only need to test 1 value - chooseCard method is tested in player | list of cards: current player's hand with one more card taken from list of cards: chosen player's hand with one less card |

### Step 4:
##### All-combination or each-choice: each-choice
