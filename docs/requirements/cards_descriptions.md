# Cards Descriptions

## Alter The Future Card
- Look at the top three or five cards of the draw pile, rearrange them in any order and put them back at the top of the pile.
- If there are fewer cards than the number of cards stated by the card, rearrange them.

## Attack Card
- Force the next player to draw two cards. This can be stacked.
- You will end your turn when you play this card.

## Cat Card
- A pair of matching Cat Cards allows you to steal a random card from another player.

## Catomic Bomb Card
- Move all the exploding kittens to the top of the draw pile, and shuffle the remainder of the deck. You don't need to draw a card.

## Curse of the Cat Butt Card
- Choose a player to curse. They must shuffle their hand, and are now unable to see their hand until they draw a card, at the end of their turn.

## Defuse Card
- Defuse an Exploding Kitten. Place the Exploding Kitten back in the deck in any location.

## Exploding Kitten Card
