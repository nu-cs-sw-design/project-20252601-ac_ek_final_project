# Intructor feedback
## Progress evaluation :scroll:
- ❔: Last week's feedback was addressed: the badge is added, great! But the board is still not used, and no implementation is found yet.
- :question: Project management board shows clear planning of action items.
- :question: Team has started working on implementing (with BVA and TDD) the Game Setup Phase.
- :white_check_mark: The weekly report is written.
- :white_check_mark: Spotbugs and Checkstyle is set up: more configuration can be done for Spotbugs. See comments below for where to find an example setup.

  
## Comments :speech_balloon:
1) For linter setup, please find Canvas --> Week 5 --> Tuesday --> After Class for an example project. Feel free to use it as a reference. Please do note that the checkstyle configuration file is a bare minimum one. It satisfies the grading rubrics for letter grade B but will not satisfy A (which requires dadpting coding standard from Clean Code.)

2) I can't find any feature branch, draft PR, or Projects board item that can tell me what the team is working on :(. I hope the team has started implementing the Game Setup Phase.
