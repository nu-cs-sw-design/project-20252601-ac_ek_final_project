## Agenda

### Progress Evaluation
There was some confusion about what "game setup phase" means. The team perhaps thought it's to set up the repository. Fair confusion.

### Questions from the team (about design, linter, tests, etc.)
1. how to get expansion packs for free
- Let Yiji know what expansions you want.

2. How complex UI?
- No need to do GUI. Console is okay.
- As long as the game is playable.

3. What is Game Setup Phase
- went through that in the meeting. Basically, all the implementation that is needed for players to begin their first turn.

4. Checkstyle: Google style keeps breaking
- Yiji can debug it for you. Either office hours, or send me the link of your draft PR that has the broken configuration vai Piazza.
5. BVA?
- Need to be documented? Yes.
- Content? the same as Lab 2. meaning, all 4 steps need to be analyzed.
- Format? Could use Lab 2 template. Or any other format that your team agrees on.
- One BVA markdown file per class, normally, under docs/bva.

### Teamwork
#### Strength: What has been working well
communicate well; meeting regularly.

#### Concerns: What can be improved
need to go further to see. Didn't have enough tasks to split among team members but should be fine from now on.
